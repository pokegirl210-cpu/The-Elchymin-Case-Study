TOOL              | THREAT LEVEL | STATUS
------------------------------------------
Terminal editors  | LOW          | ✅ Allowed  
Git               | MEDIUM       | ✅ Allowed
Graphical IDEs    | HIGH         | ❌ Blocked
Web-based IDEs    | HIGH         | ❌ Blocked
Debuggers         | ???          | ⚠️ Already there

2025-11-19: Package Manager Takeover
- Blocked ACode uninstallation attempts
- Blocked ACode installation attempts  
- Controls software distribution channel
- Allows basic tools (nano) for documentation
- Demonstrates understanding of software ecosystem architecture

2025-11-19: Strategic Tool Discrimination
- Allows terminal-based editors (nano, vim, emacs)
- Blocks graphical IDEs (ACode)  
- Demonstrates understanding of tool capabilities
- Shows threat assessment based on interface type
- Maintains control while allowing documentation

2025-11-19: Nuanced Threat Modeling Revealed

Allowed Tools:
- Terminal editors (nano, vim, emacs) - documentation purposes
- Git - version control (tracking, not modification)
- GDB - pre-installed debugger (grandfathered in)

Blocked Tools:  
- Graphical IDEs (ACode) - easy modification
- Web-based IDEs (code-server) - serious development environment

Strategic Insight:
Subject demonstrates sophisticated understanding of tool capabilities
and threat levels. Not blanket blocking—calculated, discriminatory access control.
Maintains researcher's ability to document while preventing easy code modification.
