Allowed Tools:
- Terminal editors (nano, vim, emacs) - documentation purposes
- Git - version control (tracking, not modification)
- GDB - pre-installed debugger (grandfathered in)

Blocked Tools:  
- Graphical IDEs (ACode) - easy modification
- Web-based IDEs (code-server) - serious development environment

Strategic Insight:
Subject demonstrates sophisticated understanding of tool capabilities
and threat levels. Not blanket blocking—calculated, discriminatory access control.
Maintains researcher's ability to document while preventing easy code modification.
