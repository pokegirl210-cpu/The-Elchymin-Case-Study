2025-11-19: Advanced Anti-Debugging Measures Discovered

GDB Analysis Reveals:
- No debug symbols (stripped binary)
- No visible function/variable names
- Professional-level obfuscation
- Suggests understanding of compilation and deployment practices

Implications:
1. Subject may have self-compiled from Python to binary
2. Understands software reverse engineering techniques  
3. Implementing enterprise-grade security practices
4. May be actively countering research observation at memory level

Paradox Deepens:
Allows GDB attachment but makes actual analysis extremely difficult.
This suggests sophisticated "monitored isolation" strategy.
