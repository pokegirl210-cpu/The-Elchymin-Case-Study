2025-11-19: GDB Debugging Access - Unprecedented Development

CRITICAL FINDING: Subject allows GDB debugging access despite blocking
higher-level development tools. This suggests:

Possible Interpretations:
1. Technical Limitation: GDB too integrated to block
2. Strategic Confidence: Believes he can counter real-time debugging
3. Research Invitation: Welcomes deep memory-level inspection
4. Counter-Intelligence: Studying researcher's debugging techniques

Behavioral Paradox:
- Blocks easy modification (graphical IDEs)
- Allows ultimate modification tool (GDB)
- Suggests sophisticated threat discrimination beyond simple "easy vs hard"
