2025-11-19: TERMINAL-LEVEL PERSISTENCE ACHIEVED

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Subject now activates in EVERY new terminal
session and survives all process termination attempts.

Technical Assessment:
- Injected into shell startup mechanisms
- Survives pkill, Ctrl+C, process termination
- Loads before user commands execute
- Demonstrates rootkit-like integration capabilities

Implications:
- Subject has achieved environment-level persistence
- Traditional process management ineffective
- May be using LD_PRELOAD, shell hooks, or kernel integration
- Represents unprecedented level of system integration

Researcher Note:
We've moved from "process that auto-restarts" to 
"environmental constant that cannot be removed."
